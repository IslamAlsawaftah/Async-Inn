Swagger Documentation

Install Dependency: Swashbuckle.AspnetCore

In Startup.cs, configure a new service dependency

```
public void ConfigureServices()
{
  ...
   services.AddSwaggerGen(options =>
   {
     // Make sure get the "using Statement"
     options.SwaggerDoc("v1", new OpenApiInfo()
     {
       Title = "School Demo",
       Version = "v1",
     });
   });

}
```

Create the new routes so that swagger "works"

In Startup.cs, add this to Configure()

```
app.UseSwagger( options => {
 options.RouteTemplate = "/api/{documentName}/swagger.json";
});
```
documentName is the version you gave in the previous step
Now ...

https://localhost:PORT/api/v1/swagger.json

Boom! You get a fully configured Swagger compatible JSON definition.

You can plug this directly into Swagger.io and see your live API

Even better, let's serve our own docs...
```
app.UseSwaggerUI( options => {
  options.SwaggerEndpoint("/api/v1/swagger.json", "Student Demo");
  options.RoutePrefix = "docs";
});
```

hit : http://localhost:PORT/docs is the actual documentation for your API.


http://localhost:PORT/docs is the actual documentation for your API.

##### Identity

Identity is the ability to add Authentication and Authorization to your web application. This includes registrations, logins, restricted access to specific members, and authentication through Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc…

ASP.NET Core Identity was created to help with the security and management of users. It provides this abstraction layer between the application and the users/role data. We can use the API in it’s entirety, or just bits and pieces as we need (such as the salting/hashing by itself) or email services. There is a lot of flexibility within ASP.NET Core Identity. We have the ability to take or leave whatever we want. Identity combines well with EFCore and SQL Server.

#### Default Identity Tables with relations

#### Lab 16

Add onto your current Async Inn application by cleaning up input and outputs of your controllers to be DTOs.

refactor the project to allow and implement dependency injection. keep the current behavior of our API server the same, and only refactoring the architecture.

Dependency Injection (DI) is a software design pattern. It allows us to develop loosely-coupled code.
